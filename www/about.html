<p>About ‘Where can I…? – Hawke’s Bay
There are so many great things to do outdoors in Hawke's Bay, sometimes it's tricky to choose just one. But, environmental conditions such as weather, water quality, sea conditions and air quality can all affect our activities.
Many people look at the weather before they go and work or play - either out of the window or online. There's goodly amounts of information available about other aspects of the Hawke's Bay environment, but it's in lots of different places. Some websites even have multiple pages showing related data. It's sometimes not easy for the user to find the information they need.
This project turns data provision around, by focusing on what the user wants to know, rather than what the data provider is choosing to make available. It brings together a wide spectrum of data on the natural environment, to help users find suitable places to go and play (or work). The project takes the user's perspective - allowing them to ask "where can I...?", and the activity they want to do. These are 'Where can I...?' modules.
The general principle behind 'Where can I...?' is that new modules can readily be designed to inform specific recreational activities. Not all activities need the same conditions: High wind is good for windsurfing, but bad for ocean swimming. When data from different sources can be used to help users decide where and when to go and have fun (or work!), data are being used most effectively for information.
The website uses data from the Hawke's Bay Regional Council's (HBRC) environmental datasets through XML calls to their Hilltop server. It could also aggregate data through Metservice's Python API. The data are stored in a MySQL database hosted on AWS. A Node.js server hosts the web application, with Leaflet providing mapping services on HTML via MapBox.
